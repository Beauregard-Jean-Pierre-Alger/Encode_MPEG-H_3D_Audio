This manual documents the MPEG-H 3D Audio Low Complexity Profile Encoder APIs, encode processing of different modules.

The MPEG-H 3D Audio Low Complexity Profile Encoder consists of following modules:
	1.  Core Coder
	2.  HOA - Higher Order Ambisonics encoder
	3.  OAM - Object Audio Metadata encoder
	4.  MPEG-D DRC encoder

The MPEG-H 3D Audio Low Complexity Profile Encoder sample testbench consists of:
	1. MP4 multiplexer utility to create MP4 file from MHAS file
	2. MP4 demultiplexer utility to generate MHAS file from MP4 file
	3. Sample testbench using MPEG-H 3D Audio Low Complexity Profile Encoder APIs
